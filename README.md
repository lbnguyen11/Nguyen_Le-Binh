A repo implementing a solution to check if undirected graph contains a cycle or not.

- 1. The main.cpp file on main branch: submitted solution for undirected graph problem.
- 2. The main-2nd-solution on main branch: 2nd submitted solution for undirected graph problem using BFS algorithm in CLRS book.
- 3. The feature-main.cpp file on feature branch: source code for program (tested on Ubuntu) that draws a random graph and check if it contains a cycle (and TODO list).
- 4. The feature-main-2nd-solution.cpp file on feature branch: source code for program (tested on Ubuntu) that draws a random graph and check if it contains a cycle (using BFS algorithm in CLRS book).
